# Short-video narration: silent clip → 9:16 voiced draft

English | [中文](./short-video-narration.zh-CN.md)

Three commands: `quickstart` creates a 9:16 draft with the clip on the main track, `tts` voices your script, `caption` writes captions with whisper's timing and your script's wording, then `lint` checks the result. No GUI in the loop; when you open the app, the video, voiceover and caption tracks are all still editable.

## You need

- capcut-cli (`npm install -g capcut-cli`, Node ≥ 18)
- ffmpeg
- a local TTS. The example uses [edge-tts](https://github.com/rany2/edge-tts) (`pip install edge-tts`, free neural voices); any command that can write a WAV plugs in through `--tts-cmd`
- optional: whisper (`pip install openai-whisper`) for the captions. Without it the draft still has the clip and the voiceover

## Inputs

```
clip.mp4     # silent footage, landscape or portrait (--ratio 9:16 sets the canvas)
script.txt   # narration, one sentence per line
```

Write the script yourself, or let any vision model look at the clip first. For example, sample frames and hand them to whatever model CLI you use:

```bash
mkdir -p frames && ffmpeg -v error -i clip.mp4 -vf fps=1/2 frames/%02d.jpg
<your vision-model CLI> "Write a 5-sentence spoken narration for these frames, one sentence per line, no title" frames/*.jpg > script.txt
```

The model is optional: the script is a plain text file and a hand-written one works the same.

## One command

```bash
bash examples/scripts/narrate-short.sh clip.mp4 script.txt "Narrated short" --voice en-US-AriaNeural
```

`--drafts <dir>` names the draft library; without it the machine's default directory is used. The script only chains the four steps below.

## Step by step

```bash
# 1. Portrait draft, clip on the main track
capcut quickstart "Narrated short" --video clip.mp4 --ratio 9:16
#    draft_path in the result is the draft folder

# 2. Voiceover at 0s. edge-tts only writes MP3 and `capcut tts` expects the engine
#    to write a WAV at {out}, so examples/scripts/edge-tts-wav.sh converts in between
capcut tts "<draft_path>" 0s --text-file script.txt \
  --tts-cmd "bash examples/scripts/edge-tts-wav.sh {text} {out} en-US-AriaNeural"
#    segment_id in the result is the voiceover segment

# 3. Captions: timing from whisper, wording from your script
capcut caption "<draft_path>" --from-segment <segment_id> --script script.txt

# 4. Check
capcut lint "<draft_path>" -H
```

Restart CapCut / JianYing once so it lists the new draft, then open it.

## Other voices, other engines, caption styling

- edge-tts voices: `edge-tts --list-voices` (`--voice` or the `EDGE_TTS_VOICE` environment variable)
- other engines: any command that writes a WAV to `{out}`. `{text}` is optional; without it the script is piped to stdin (how piper works). macOS `say`: `--tts-cmd "say -o {out} --data-format=LEI16@24000 {text}"`; in the script, override with the `CAPCUT_TTS_CMD` environment variable
- caption styling: `caption --preset <preset.json>` (extract one with `make-preset` from a caption you styled in the app) or `--style-ref <segment-id>`; `--karaoke` for word highlighting

### Captions without Whisper

`caption --audio` / `--from-segment` need Whisper installed. Three routes work without it:

- **The app's own auto captions.** Run CapCut's "Auto captions" (JianYing 识别字幕), save, close the app, then keep going from the CLI: `capcut restyle "<draft_path>" --preset preset.json` (add `--track-name <name>` to touch one caption track) and `capcut export-srt "<draft_path>" > captions.srt` (`--format vtt`, `--granularity word`).
- **An SRT you already have**, for example one the app exported: `capcut import-srt "<draft_path>" captions.srt --clone-style` (`--time-offset 2s` shifts it).
- **Word timings from an external forced aligner** such as WhisperX (`whisperx voice.wav --output_format json`) or Qwen3-ForcedAligner (per character for Chinese): `capcut caption "<draft_path>" --words aligned.json`, with `--script script.txt` to keep your script's wording on the aligner's timing, `--karaoke` / `--word-reveal` as usual, and `--words -` to read stdin. Accepted shapes, detected automatically and reported as `words_format`: Whisper / whisper.cpp `segments[].words[]`, WhisperX `word_segments[]`, or a plain array of `{"word"|"text"|"char", "start", "end"}` in seconds (`start_ms`/`end_ms` and `start_time`/`end_time` keys work too). Times are timeline positions, as with `--audio`. Entries without timing are skipped (`words_skipped`); an entry that ends before it starts or goes back in time is refused with `refused [words-invalid]` and its index.

## JianYing 6.0+

A draft created this way is plaintext; JianYing 11.4 (macOS) is reported to open and upgrade it in place, other builds are unverified. Existing encrypted drafts are not read by this CLI; `capcut decrypt <project>` reports the state, and [jianying-encryption.md](../docs/jianying-encryption.md) has the background.
